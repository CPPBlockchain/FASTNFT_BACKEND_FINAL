OFFICIAL FULLSTACK NFT PLATFORM BY CPP FAST BLOCKCHAIN

Our goal this semester was to successfully create a fullstack nft minting platform that implements on-chain metadata with svg.

The FAST logo has been converted into svg format and we have randomized the background color of the logo.

Each mint will declare the randomized function that uses Keccak256 with given parameters to generate arbitrary hexadecimal on each iteration of the mint.
